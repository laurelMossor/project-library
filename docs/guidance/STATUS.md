# Project Library — Status

> Live tracker for where we are on the road to **closed beta release**. Update as things move; brevity is the feature. This is the single "where are we right now?" doc Claude reads at the start of every session.

**Last updated:** 2026-04-11
**Overall goal:** Closed beta release — invite-only site, realistic feedback from 5–10 users.
**Authoritative plan:** [Closed Beta – Project Plan (Google Doc)](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1Zjz7i0VSmv1Twy9otR_oq6KHtPexHettzY183VB9zLw/edit) · mirrored work estimates table is the ground truth for what's left.
**Ticket board:** [ProLib Tickets (Notion)](https://www.notion.so/2d6453d029b080e99ebffce9169b18c6)

## In flight (Milestone 2 — Spats Launch)

Sourced from `docs/scratch/SPATS_LAUNCH.md` + the [Spats Launch Notion ticket](https://www.notion.so/2e1453d029b0801c9790fa897a7332eb). Check marks reflect the journal and in-repo notes.

- [ ] **Task 1 — Page roles**: decide if Pages need an ultimate Owner (vs current ADMIN/EDITOR/MEMBER). Currently leaning toward "not yet."
- [ ] **Task 2 — Microsite features** (biggest unknown): PRD in `docs/scratch/PAGE_MICROSITE_PRD.md`. Needs technical plan for structural fields (category, pinned_post rich text) and composable PageElement table. Touches schema.
- [ ] **Task 2a — About subpage**: distinct from profile body. Decision pending: is it a Post in disguise or its own type?
- [x] **Task 3 — Pinned posts** — schema + UI + max-3 enforcement shipped 2026-04-03
- [x] **Task 4 — Profile pictures** — upload/remove modal + brown ring shipped 2026-04-03
- [ ] **Task 5 — Photo captions** — implementation done, **no entry point to add captions yet**
- [x] **Task 6 — Map view** — `CollectionMap` component shipped 2026-04-03
- [ ] **Admin tools — Group member management** — not started (existing Notion ticket)

## Not yet started — gates on closed beta (M3 + M4)

From the Beta Plan's Work Estimates table. These are not optional for release; they're just not Spats.

**Testing & polish (M3):**
- [ ] P0 & P1 design features — the plan itself says "(list them)". The list is a TODO.
- [ ] P0 & P1 bugs — no triaged list exists yet
- [ ] N+1 refactor sweep — partial work done 2026-03-23; no systematic pass yet
- [ ] Non-offset pagination on collections

**Beta details (M4):**
- [ ] Clear onboarding / "what is this?" / "how to"
- [ ] Beta flag + notes at login/signup
- [ ] Community guidelines page
- [ ] About page
- [ ] Landing page with images, links, and headers
- [ ] Research plan + first 5–10 user sessions

**Narrative gaps in the plan itself** (decisions needed, not just tickets):
- Moderation posture for the beta (lack thereof, flags, disclaimers)
- User expectations: data retention, what breaks, how to report
- What does the "something wrong?" escape hatch look like

## Recently closed (last ~2 weeks)

Most recent first. See `JOURNAL.md` for full entries.

- **2026-04-03** — Invite-gated signup: `SignupInvite` model, `?invite=` URL flow, `DEV_SIGNUP_BYPASS_SECRET` for local/Playwright, `npm run invite:create`
- **2026-04-03** — SPATS Tasks 3–6: pinned posts, profile pictures, image captions (no entry point yet), map view via `CollectionMap`
- **2026-04-02** — Unified user/page profile pages via `ProfileHeader` + `ProfileButtons` + `ProfileBody`; self-service page membership (`JoinButton`); fixed page-based messaging bug and conversation data leak
- **2026-04-01** — Profile-scoped unread message notifications (`UnreadCountContext`, per-profile dots, 60s polling)
- **2026-03-29** — Messages overhaul: `MessagesPageView` with `TabbedPanel`, page-vs-user identity fix
- **2026-03-27** — Playwright E2E suite (19 tests), observability pass (`@vercel/analytics`, JSON logging, `logAction()`), profile switching via `ActiveProfileContext`

## Blockers / open questions

- **Microsite refactor shape.** Task 2 is big and the schema direction (`PageElement` table per PRD) isn't committed. Needs a technical plan before implementation.
- **P0/P1 design feature list doesn't exist.** Plan literally calls it out as a TODO — can't check off "design polish" without enumerating it first.
- **No bug triage.** Same problem as above but for bugs. Would want a triage pass before the "done" criteria is meaningful.
- **Caption entry point.** Image captions work but there's no UI to add them yet (Task 5).

## How to use this doc

- **Claude reads this at session start** (configured in `.claude/CLAUDE.md`). Keep it one screen.
- When something ships, move it from "In flight" to "Recently closed" with a date.
- When a blocker lifts, delete it — don't keep "solved in 04/03" historical notes here. This is *status*, not *history*. History lives in `JOURNAL.md`.
- When scope changes, edit the milestone section. Don't accumulate cruft.
