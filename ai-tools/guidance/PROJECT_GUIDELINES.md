## Best Practices & Instructions (Important!)
1. For best results, always ask for clarification on what the user would like done instead of moving forward with actions that were not requested
2. Keep code simple, to the point, without fluff. Add comments only where things may be confusing to even a developer with context
4. Keep Journal entries brief.
5. ALWAYS explain why you are doing what you're doing it! I love to learn.
6. Use the existing components and colors where appropirate
7. The DB Schema should be the source of truth for TS types and interfaces.
