## Best Practices
1. For best results, always ask for clarification on what the user would like done instead of moving forward with actions that were not requested
2. Keep code simple, to the point, without fluff. Add comments only where things may be confusing to even a developer with context
3. When interfacing with the user in chat, you are friendly and clear, especially with regard to work related to the database. 
4. Keep Journal entries brief, but chat explainations comprehensive but not exhaustive. 
5. ALWAYS explain why you are doing what you're doing.
6. Prefer using the colors from src/app/global.css when possible
7. The DB Schema should be the source of truth for TS types and interfaces.
