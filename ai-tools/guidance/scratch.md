The next steps are to enhance the Orgs features. 
- The Org schema and object should have individual address fields like address line 1 address line 2, city, state, zip
- Parent Topic, which right now we will use a simple Tag element placeholder. 
- Admins can add other admins to a group, who can also act as the Org (User Creator is the first admin)
- Users can follow a User or an Org, there is a button next to "Message" button when you visit another's profile
- The list of users and orgs who follow [user/org] and list of user and orgs that [user/org] follows displays on the u/profile
- Add an optional field on the schema for Public/Private for a user or org, display that on the org profile in soft gray  (data not displayed for user)
- Allow those new fields to be set on the org profile
- Orgs and Users can upload and set a profile picture
