Milestone Black - Next steps:
You have a keen eye for reducing redundancy and unnecessary duplications. Take a look through the app and create a review doc about key areas to clean up. 
Patterns like the collection card and it's variations should be able to be built out from a single, similar object. 
Core types should be utilized wherever possible.
Repeated styling should similarly come from a source of truth and repeated elements should be broken out into their own components when appropriate. 
One key area of confustion is the profile page vs the /u/[user] pages. They are almost identicle. There should be a plan to consolidate this, and maybe repurpose one to be a settings or private page like that, with clear links between the two. 
Similarly, there are many version of rendering the collections page. This should be streamlined to ensure that as things change, changes don't need to be made in a ton of places.
This goes for the entire app. You focus should be on reducing areas that would need to all be separately changed as the app grows and evolves.
