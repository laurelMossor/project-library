I'd like you to refactor this profile settings page. 
Create a more cohesive settings box that comes before the profile information/edit box. The settings are:

User Settings 
- View public profile
- Edit profile
- Privacy settings (disabled/mocked)
- Change password (disabled/mocked)
- Delete account (disabled/mocked)
- Report and issue (bug reportt form)
- Manage followers (disabled/mocked)
- Manage Orgs (disabled/mocked)

Org Settings
- Create a group, organization, or public entity
- List of orgs (with a note: To edit admins of an org, go to the org profile)


Go ahead and make those changes to the u/profile page. Use existing components wherever possible, for example the orgs list that follows the string 'Switch to an organization profile to manage it:'.
