# Project Journal Notes
## Journal Guidelines
1. When requested by the user (i.e. "Please add to the journal"), add a log above the previous one
2. Rune `date` to get the date and time, use that as the headline (Convert date to format-> Day MM/DD/YYYY HH:MM TMZ)
3. Write a brief summary of what has been changed or updated since the last journal. No need to document every little nuance. Include major changes, and current challenges at a high level
4. For now, treat them like a substantially detailed commit message with some details but not a ton. User will indicate if they want more details than that.

Initialized Next.js project manually (App Router, TypeScript, Tailwind CSS). Created core config files: `tsconfig.json`, `next.config.ts`, `tailwind.config.ts`, `postcss.config.mjs`. Set up base `src/app/` structure with layout, page, and global styles. Added `.gitignore` for node_modules and build artifacts. Project is now runnable with `npm run dev`.

I initialized the project plan and a folder with tools for the AI Agent such as the project guidelines with best practices, and the journal for notes about sessions and what has been done. No git or code yet.
